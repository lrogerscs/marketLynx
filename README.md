### Development Reflection:
marketLynx is my first true experience using JavaFX to build an application. 
The application was built over the course of 1-1.5 months worth of learning and testing. 
Before working on this project, I was only briefly exposed to JavaFX as a framework.
The extent of my experience was extremely basic, with little knowledge on how to manage panes and other elements. 
For this project, I also had to learn Maven architecture and CSS styling.
Due to time and responsibility limitations, I am uploading the project now.
I will include future improvements to coding styles and possible bugs or issues as they appear.
### Feedback:
Open to all constructive feedback one may have.
