### Development Reflection:
marketLynx is my first experience using JavaFX to build an application. 

The application was built over the course of one to one and a half months of learning and testing in 2023. 
Before working on this project, I was only briefly exposed to the JavaFX GUI framework through class examples.
Heretofore, I had little knowledge in managing and manipulating dynamic elements within JavaFX;
also, I was not well-versed in the many opportunities afforded by it.

Additionally, I learned about Maven architecture and CSS styling to benefit project structure and visuals.

Due to time and responsibility restrictions, I have published the project now.
However, I will continue to add improvements to coding styles and apparent issues.
In subsequent updates, I plan to implement data forecasting.
