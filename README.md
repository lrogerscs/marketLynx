### Development Reflection:
marketLynx is my first experience using JavaFX to build an application. 
The application itself was built over the course of 1-1.5 months worth of learning and testing. 
Before working on this project, I was only briefly exposed to the JavaFX GUI framework.
The extent of my experience was extremely basic, with little knowledge in managing panes and other elements. 
For this project, I additionally learned Maven architecture and CSS styling.
Due to time and responsibility restrictions, I have uploaded the project now.
However, I will continue to include improvements to coding styles and possible issues.
In addition, I plan to increase versatility by adding data forecasting techniques.
